sera07,"neglecting yourself entirely, not just that but routinely doing the exact opposite of what's gonna help you feel better cos your brain convinces you it'll just make you feel worse or you're too exhausted to even try. 

Good friendships crumble into nothing cos you just stop maintaining them. Sending one single text message is like climbing a mountain, forget about leaving the house to meet up, so eventually your friends just stop trying - and why shouldn't they. Being ignored isn't nice, being cancelled on isn't nice, and they're not in your head. They can't feel the things you feel. From their perspective, you're just an ass. 

it's a vicious, self-perpetuating cycle and it's so, so hard to break out of. Not only that, recovery's not even a straight line or a thing you can even really get to the end of. It's up and down, it comes and goes. Meds do help but there's no magic pill. Therapy helps too, but it's hard to access and you get as much as you put in - which is already hard cos depression makes it hard to put effort into anything. 

it's not just being sad. Depression makes you sad, sure, but the actual feeling is just pure hopelessness. At its worst it's unending despair, it's sobbing into your pillow in the middle of the night because there's a hole inside you and you don't know how to fix it, or it's spending an entire day feeling completely numb, not even bothering to shower or feed yourself because you don't even notice those are things you need to do.

There is nothing that keeps you here, no strong reason..
You lost interest on everything you enjoyed to do, and you keep asking ""why do I have to get out of bed? Why do I have to surfer for what? For whom?"".
You didn't have any appetite (in my case, and only weed would make me hungry, or I would leave the days with almost no food, other people tend to try compensate that feeling of void by over eating, depends).

You can't feel ""real love"", from your friends or family or you partner, they love you but you can't feel it,. You can't see it and maybe finally you will want to be alone, just alone, everyday you loose any interest in others, nothing left anymore.

As top comment said (well explained mate! EDIT: @tenamonth), you feel somehow out of this world, you don't know how to act, what to do, you start acting bit weird, avoiding reality, your are stocking bills you have to pay somewhere in your living, you just don't give a sh*t about..

And things get worse and worse once it's on that pathway.

You start not to pay attention to yourself, you let things go, you don't have that much respect for yourself anymore and everyday it fades a bit more, you don't take care of yourself (or anyone else), also your living can rapidly be turned upside down, cleaning isn't that important anymore, as everything gets over time... it's  just not important.
You get away from your responsibilities, you can sleep really long (Or will have to deal with insomnia) but you constantly feel tired, every little piece of joy goes in the regrets, you loose your confidence, you just feel more and more useless 

at this point, depending on your personality and habits, you could start increase alcohol or whatever'.
Derealization can happen, you don't have the impression to be the commander of your life, things just happens..

Time pass, you don't realise the time you loose doing nothing, at this point, or you get kind of electrochock, by yourself, by a close friend, anyone can wake you up and stop you bullying your own grave.
Or a psychedelic journey wakes you up that's another story'.

So you know, everyone will react differently and all depressions are not the same also, but That's range of things happening, you can go really fast down, but getting out of it isn't really easy, without help it's not a nice ride.

Medications often don't work that great and you have bunch of side effects, you are lucky if a SSRI or related drug is working without a bunch of nasty side effects.

That's depression.
How it goes for me, while it's pretty bad, others may react differently but it's common features, as is the complete loss of hope.

I can't wish that to happen to my worse enemy..
Anxiety pops up, and you have no idea what you are supposed to do, so it again pushes anxiety up, never ending loop.

EDIT: 
Feeling lost. Alone. No words to explain the pain.
You can't explain how you feel to someone that never went down..the others may try to figure out how you feel, because they know how it can be, but it's not possible to explain emotions, to start with, it's inside of your heart.

Very close friends or family,... someone's strongly bounded to you will be hable to give you a hand to help you get up (but mostly while depressed, you don't even see it),  because there are some rare people, real friends, you don't have a bunch, if you have one real friend it's huge, you don't need to speak much, you share emotions in silence, I know what I mean, my best friend saved me while I had a psychotic breakdown (I never had that so strong, it happened once) while in deep depression, he came in just at the right last time .. I was ready to end it,  knife in hand, sharp as razor blade.
He literally jumped on me catched my harms to grab the  knife and put it away, it was a really dangerous situation, never would I have hurt him intentionally, even if I was psychotic, it's my best friend would never be able to hurt him in any way (that said...), but we where both hurt, but I'm the only that stabbed myself accidentally, pretty deep cut that passed near my left lung.. thanks he has not.
I would feel terrible.

I wanted to add this story.
I never had such a psychotic breakdown anymore since, and I can't remember of such a bad episode.

It was close, he came see me really at the right last moment before I would have opened my veins.
He saved my life, I cried afterward, I remember I kept holding his hand while calming down (I was really really agitated for hours apparently, throwing things in my room etc.. it wasn't me, I'm not like that, he had to hold me as tight as he could, I was angry toward everything, didn't kept calm,  that's how he as been hurt also, I still feel so sorry for that but most overall, thankful, he doesn't look physically strong, I'm stronger than him, but he managed to hold me, I just can imagine the adrenaline rush he had, we still don't know how he managed to hold me all the time I calm down), I know I would have done exactly the same for him, he knows also .
We know us for about 20 years.

I've found 2 times someone close to me, died (yes I sometimes have the impression life is jocking with me..) so I know the pain and trauma related to it, I want no-one to find me as it happened to me, another story.

It was the last time suicide attempt came into my mind.
This changed a lot of things.

That's what I really want to add, depression is horrible, but you are likely not alone, I didn't realized the (few) people worrying for me, like him, as I wrote, while depressed you feel so lonely, but that day, I realized I was not, giving his hand to help, but I couldn't see.
He didn't thought about the danger, I was covered in blood once calm and crying, we both didn't realized the wound I had it was psychologically and physically very exhausting and I think also really choking, for both of us, we didn't realized how ""bad"" (I was very lucky in a way) the injury was, and he stayed there until I ""came down"" and finally felt asleep (Yes they weren't able to stitch the wound as I waited too long (>12h and it's too late) to go to the ER, also another story, I had put a bandage and disinfecting it but didn't wanted to look at it, yes stupid but I was so ashamed I just wanted that day not to exist.

Finally the pain was too high there was something wrong, so I went to ER, they asked if I had been attacked and struggled to find a phone to call (because they have to report knife/bullet injuries to police normally)..no I just thought it was ok haha, was not).
Difficult to give a ""coherent"" explanation.

Also I think the pain from the knife that went to my ribs also brought me back to the solid physical reality, like a double waking, I was not alone, and I could have died stupidly.
This brings you back in concrete world.

Why did I felt the need to write this?
Because you ask what's depression, I was going kill myself there, but was stopped in my action because of this friend that didn't evaluate the danger and just came as fast as possible.

-> I really want to point out with that story, there are people who really care way more about you than you think, never be desperate, no depression is not z a game and it's hard, and you don't see the help others try to bring, you are in your little bubble, not seeing those carrying about you..
What happened that day really woke me up.

Please, I don't say go OD by a friend and hope he/she will bring you unconditional support, not wise.
I want to say, be attentive, take a step back and you will see these people that cares about you''.

So yes ..it's really long but this story is of major importance for me. They may actually probably be someone ready to to really far to help you, without you even noticing.
Be aware of that.

And some lecture isn't that bad I think, unless it's full ot writing errors, in that case I'm sorry.


//END OF EDIT.
*SORRY, PRETTY LONG I KNOW.



Life has no fck' logic anymore, you wake up for no real reason, you just do it because it's supposed what you have to do, that's all.
You can start to get suspicious, you can lost trust you had for people close to you.

Some are going to spend all their money in stores, it's all just about having the desire to avoid your existence.
It's not always that bad, sometimes it is even harder, to the point where death seems a viable solution.
To avoid your pain, but also to avoid other people pain you feel you are responsible for.

All good
.
Difficult question, it's not the same for everyone, and there are certain ""levels"" in depression.


Be strong if you are actually facing depression, you are certainly not alone.
Ho yes, don't put people and yourself in danger, put your knives and other dangerous stuffs away if you think you may be near something similar, if you already have considered to attempt suicide, don't be affrayed or ashamed to ask help, to talk.
Find the right person. For example that friend (and that's something we share till always, I think), didn't liked while I was talking about how I was feeling, he would feel bad, that's how it is to have too much empathy, I know how it is.. and even if he tries, after some time it's too much, and it's the same for me, but I can stand more, facing really hard events.. or you decide to quite this world, and/or you get out stronger but also with some psychological pain/issues you will have to work on and deal with.. 
And fear of death seemed to fade away always more consistently.

Also I think there is a ""acute depression"", while things just go completely out of control, were one can be stupidly compulsive, and a kind of more mellow and constant depression (these are like phases, switching from one to the other).
The first one can let to uncontrollable crying, while the other can let place to hanger.
Also we can get out of it, it's not necessarily ""lifelong"" such as many doctors/ psychiatrists can say it.

[deleted],"Continuous questions of ""why"" or ""what's the point"". 

The go to statement in my mind that has been raised since I was about 12 is... ""We live to be educated, so we can work. We work so we can retire. We retire so we can die"". 

I've never personally believed I'll live to retirement, so my while life is a series of ""what's the point, we die anyway"".

Gotta be a cog in the wheel, life is programmed in us so we can give our best years contributing to society, to working 40 hours a week, making a mark that will never be recognized and then forgotten as soon as we retire. Neglected if our brain's aren't sharp while we grey. 

Elderly aren't looked upon as people who built our cities, they're neglected, working for 50 years might get a nice leaving party but you're hardly a thought the following week. 

Depression is finding life, being excited and living life, being happy for a moment, only to let intrusive thoughts take hold and realizing that you don't matter. You don't have the energy to care but you pretend like this world matters. You're the black sheep not really understanding how people can be happy to give up their life to be a part of a system that doesn't actually work for you but you're the minority, so you have to pretend it's a world you can live in, all the while just feeling numb and indifferent to 'normal' people. 

All of which, is very lonely. Surrounded by family, friend's, being in a relationship, none of that makes you feel like you're NOT alone. No matter if you have family or friends or are living life without support, you just feel disconnected from the ways society deems as normal.

teh_punk32x,"Pretty much what others have mentioned here.

Exhaustion to where fighting to stay conscious feels damn near impossible, loneliness so bad that you break down silently shaking, anger that's too tired to do anything but be angry at yourself, the lack of anything being even remotely interesting even with things that you once had a great passion for, amongst a bunch of other stuff.

The 3 I had a lot of trouble with that I didn't see anyone else post was:

1. An odd cold (I usually run hot) that literally feels like it starts in my chest and runs outward to the rest of my body. I'd be absolutely fine, walk into my room and for no reason it just hits. My legs turn to jelly and I start sobbing uncontrollably, trying to angrily and silently stop. Of course that makes it worse and I just crawl somewhere that someone couldn't find me in my pitiful state. It literally felt like my soul left my body leaving behind a husk shaped me.

2. I couldn't see people's faces. Not in a literal sense, but like I could see someone's face but if I made eye contact, the person's face would warp and start to vortex inward and/or crumble and my anxiety would sky rocket from there and I my skin would crawl as if millions of tiny creature were trying to move my skin around. This happened with not just new people but old friends and even my own family. I couldn't see my mom, my sister and my dad's face and for some reason they felt unfamiliar to me. Lot of people just assumed I'm some freak who was too much of a bitch to make eye contact. If it was a girl I was talking to I couldn't even muster words beyond hello.

3. A numbness so bleak I didn't care for my well being, but the thing that sacred me was that I couldn't care of one of my family members died. That one fucked me up because I just could not care hard as I might and I'm a protective older brother and before the depression I would go out of my way to make sure people didn't fuck with anyone in my fam. When it hit I had some dreams I don't care to talk about and I felt nothing, even though dreams similar to that in the past would have me screaming as I wake up.

If you're going through shit hope it gets better. All I can really honestly tell you is that it gets easier, but it doesn't really fully go away (at least for me). That's thing I don't think people talk about. People always say it gets better so you're left to think oh this will all go away. Unfortunately I don't think it does, it's learning for yourself how to cope. I learned how to cope through dark humor which most now think I'm just an asshole for, but it beats me trying to take my own life a few times. Also laughing at something fucking stupid is much better than feeling nothing, IMHO.

I found that the anti-depressants actually made it worse and contributed to daily suicidal ideation. 
It wasn’t until I suffered from encephalitis and placed on an anti convulsant….that is also used as mood stabilizer, in combination with medical cannabis that I was able to get off and stay off the anti-depressants.
They were the worst thing that ever happened to me.

[deleted],"How one describes and experiences depression depends on so many things with some of the biggest being age, fitness, intelligence, trauma history, any and all efforts to cope whether they be constructive or destructive, intentional or unintentional. 

In general, it feels much more dramatic when you are a teen or young adult. I had intense grief and anger with how avoidant and oblivious culture and society were to how screwed up and self harming the state of humanity is. I was mad at parents for perpetuating trauma and toxic narratives in their kin. I was mad at public school for their obviously bogus narratives and forced assimilation. I was mad that the nastiest people seemed to be the most well suited. These things caused me intense manic insomnia for days on end at college age. I was excellent at dissociating as a survival mechanism whenever shit hit the fan making me a great person to have around in an emergency where everyone was panicking. However on ordinary days I simply felt distant and separate from the people around me. I often lacked motivation for months at a time. I dropped out of college four times despite getting easy A’s on exams. I sought  refuge in socially isolated outdoor manual labor which quieted my mind at least during the work day. I learned how to maintain my basic obligations while completely dissociated out of necessity. I stopped being mad and fatalistic and simply became numb. Able to forget the events of entire seasons as if I lost months at a time. Now entering my mid 30’s I’m somehow better than ever despite being crippled by physical wear and tear. I don’t worry, I sleep, I’m almost never reactive even when faced with stress and aggressively combative people. I don’t ruminate for days and years when something bad happens. I don’t worry. 

If any young people read this, for most of you, if you can survive, it will most likely get easier as you get older. Take care of your physical body as much as you can, learn about acceptance and try to apply it. You don’t have to say something with full conviction for it to affect your narrative. Try to gain the ability to hold multiple perspectives in your thinking. When you’re at wits end, be gentle with yourself and others. You have time.",1652567471.0,2

I get dark thoughts everyday even if I’m not necessarily sad or having a bad day. The world looks like an uninviting place even if I’m at somewhere I loved to be.

Just sort of stagnant, and isolated, and an overwhelming sense of dread to the point I feel numb. I lose all interest in anything I've ever previously enjoyed, and any glimpse of enjoyment feels alien to me like I don't deserve it. I avoid reaching out because I don't know what to say or don't want to burden anyone with it when I do have something to say.

Despair_Disease,"Depends on the day, and how bad it is. When I'm not on my meds or forget to take it, it feels like... being bored? I'm not quite sure how to describe it. It's like, I want to do *something*, but I also don't have the energy to do anything, so I kinda just lay there.

If I go more than a few days without my meds, or if I'm having a bad day, it feels like extreme apathy. I'll find myself thinking ""what's the point?"" about literally everything. ""I should shower... what's the point? I'm not going anywhere anyway."" ""I should eat... what's the point? I'll just die eventually anyway.""

If I'm completely off my meds for a while, or am having a really bad day, it's like intense self-loathing combined with the apathy before. Like, I constantly think ""God I just wish I was dead"", followed with reasons I should be: ""Nobody likes you anyway""/""You're just a burden on everyone""/""Everyone would be so much happier without you"". This is then usually coupled with guilt over not killing myself, and extreme overreactions on the results of living. ""Think about that sandwich you ate today. Someone else could have eaten it. Someone who's actually *worth something*. But instead, it went to you. The waste of space.""

Other people's kindness makes me feel bad for not making more of an effort, which makes me feel worse about myself. I just go back and forth between being upset at others, then at myself because I know they did nothing wrong. Then more at myself because I know I didn't either, but goddammit why can't I make myself do better, do anything. No food tastes or sounds good to me, nothing to look forward to, struggling to remember the last time I actually felt happy. Unable to, which makes me even more unhappy.

ZChick4410," I have mood swings I can't explain. So many things feel like the sound of scraping glass and I get so short and angry with people. I feel quiet, cut off, and lonely, and everything in the world feels like it's four feet away from me and I can't get to it. Like it's all behind a pane of glass. 

The worst part is I lose track of reality sometimes. I see something bad on TV and then my mind starts responding as if it happened to me or my loved ones. Like.. I'll see a child die on TV in some show, or hear about something awful happening to a kid from the news, and then I am full of sadness and panic both for that child but also for my child as if this horrible thing has happened to my kid. I can see them in my mind in the situation and I start to lose track of what happened to whom. Usually I can fix it by going to see my child and getting the reality input that no, my kid is fine, this isn't really happening. 

Similarly, sometimes I can't rememeber if the good things we did today were things we did or things that someone else did they I'm incorrectly responding to.  I have panic attacks over this kind of stuff at the drop of a hat. My world off medication vs on are two very different places. I am thankful every single day for the medication I take that clears everything up. No panic attacks, no issues understanding what's happening. No mood swings. I have all the emotions I'm supposed to have in the right quantities without scary excess.",1652580248.0,2
Expensive-Most2796,"There’s a good quote from Office Space that I think about a lot when talking about my experience with depression. 
It goes, “Every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it. So that means that every single day that you see me, that's the worst day of my life.”

A lot of people think that the average day for a depressed person is constant turmoil. Repeated sobbing and continuous misfortune throughout the day.

For me everyday is nothing. The idea of going to events is agitating and purposeless, yet the idea of doing nothing is a waste and shameful. Yet everyday ends up as nothing, which when added up makes your life seem like a dead end road that had nothing of value on your journey there.

I know I should get better, try new things, get help, etc. But depression traps that knowledge against your desire, which is nothing.
“I should reach out, but it’s so much work”
“I should pick up a new hobby, but it takes so long to get to a level where I’ll enjoy it.”
“I should take my pills, but do I deserve to?”

Your feelings feel dampened by this sense of impending nothingness and that you aren’t worth the time and needs to spend on yourself. The idea of caring for yourself seems like a useless endeavor that sucks up the little energy you have after already hating yourself. “What’s the point, my rooms going to just get messy again anyway.”

It’s hard, and it’s a continuous eternal battle that I fear I’ll never be able to manage to the level of being an average functioning human life form, in fact many times I’ve convinced myself it’s not worth fighting against as it’s never going to go away (since I have MMD).

But you wonder sometimes if you’ll make it another day. The worst case scenarios always seem to creep up in your mind. The thought of if I dont keep doing something i’ll miss important things and bad things will happen. 

This is more along the anxiety side of things. But for me I just describe it as hopelessness. And then comes like others have said. Not feeling like doing anything. Being overly mentally exhausted. Nothing to look forward to. No future goals to achieve. Just plain boring existence.

Psychiatrist should ask u many questions to see how u get there and accordingly suggest a therapy or meds. 
Tell us what u feel and what made u doubt that u have a depression. Feeling sad or upset may ruin ur mood for some days or weeks but ur brain would still smile for a good joke.

You have better days, but sometimes even those are tainted by the fear, that it's gonna come back. I fear, that I'm wasting everybody's time. That they would be better off without me.

BrassicClassic,"My particular depression demon is always telling me that I'm not good enough.  I'm not good enough to be a father to my children, but good enough to be a partner for my significant other, but good enough at my job.  If I'm not good enough, and I'm never going to be good enough, then what's the point?

Also, my brain doesn't have the properly functional neuro-circuit that gives me the chemical feel good stuff for little wins, like coming home after a good day at work and feeling good about it, or feeling good about finally completing that task, or getting that award or recognition.  None of that gives me any feel good win at all.

On days that are bad, I'm usually not aware that I'm having a bad day until my resilience wears out.  I'm constantly fighting those demons, but the days that are bad are the ones where I'm only able to fight through part of the day, and I'm not able to make it all the way through, and I find myself crying, struggling to keep my head above the waters of my own drowning depression.  Others love me.  Others point out how successful I am in all the different areas of my life.  Sometimes, it just doesn't matter.  If I can't feel it, can't see it, then it doesn't help me at all.

Everything you do is on auto pilot because why bother? 

You cry for no reason. Someone says something nice and you have to hide so you can cry and collect yourself and carry on like nothing happened.. but you remember the only reason people are being nice is to be polite. It doesn't mean anything. These people don't know you, they are not your friend.. they don't care. 

You're at a red light or waiting at the bus stop and think how easy it would be to throw yourself in traffic ..  yea ok people will be sad, but not for long.. but you don't because knowing your luck you'll probably screw up and make yourself a vegetable or something.  

You are hungry but nothing sounds appealing.  Showering takes effort. That book that started off good... meh.  You just want to sleep. You're not tired but your soul is.
 TV and music is background  noise.. 

You go home to a stupid pet who for some reason won't leave you alone and it's so damn irritating and as the pet curls into you, you hate it don't touch me I need this and  quietly sob into your pillow to it all again tomorrow..

FreyaAthena,"Doing nothing, kinda wanting to do something but not bored enough or feeling the urge to actually do something. Doing something feels like work, doesn't matter if it's work/cleaning or a hobby/something fun. Trying to spring into action feels like fighting gravity, something is constantly keeping you physically down, so mentally you have to accept that's the way it is or taking a lot of energy to do the smallest task.

When someone forces you to do something you like you find out that the startup energy is quite high (mentally) but to keep going you don't spend that much and you feel much better afterwards. The high startup cost doesn't always seem worth it or feels like energy you don't have. It's really hard to get through.

When it's something you have to do like cleaning it takes a lot of energy and to keep going is really difficult. Usually it would be a rather small task, but because you didn't keep up it became a mountain. After you finished the task it's satisfying, but stop halfway and the energy spent feels useless. The only way to keep going is to get to the endpoint, but because your energy reserves are lower that isn't always possible.

If I have to do it by myself I need to think of something at that moment and immediately do it. Thinking about it for a minute isn't an option, that always turns into never. If I want to play a game I need to open Steam right now and click on play. If I want to do groceries I need to grab my money and keys and leave. If I want to wash clothes I need to grab my laundry and go to the washing machine. No amount of thinking can come between idea and action.

I have lists in my phone for actions, so I can head out the door for groceries and get the stuff I need. It does happen that I buy too many onions for example, they're on the list and I can't remember whether or not I have some at home. It's not ideal, but it's sorta manageable this way.
