techie_boy69,"Life is bloody hard on so many levels, the crazy ideas that go nowhere, the buying into ideas and hobbies you drop instantly, the sky high highs and lows of relationships burn most normal people out. the inability not to be reactive to situations and the emotions that come with it is a constant problem, especially as a guy. most people take for granted planning and executive functions but that’s broken with ADHD so constantly forgetting and putting off or just blind to doing the things that are important short medium and long term. I know what I need to do but just can’t so it’s chaos and deadline chasing all the time. Then the F*#k it risk taking that other just think your crazy and the ADHD brain thinks it’s great fun, it’s great in your teens and 20’s if it doesn’t kill you, but catastrophic as you get older.",1638452984,916
[deleted],"There’s a profound mental discomfort when doing something “your brain” doesn’t want to do, if you’re medicated. It’s genuinely mentally taxing to do things that are “boring”, even if they’re something you want to be doing. Now, this is better than when you’re unmedicated, where it’s simply impossible to push through and force yourself to do them at all.

Something that hasn’t been mentioned anywhere is the depression. ADHD inherently messes with your reward system, and in doing so, can in and of itself be a cause for depression (specifically one that looks similar to persistent depressive disorder with depressive episodes). Many ADHD symptoms are actually persistent-depressive symptoms, or made worse by the depression involved.

It’s also often comorbid with anxiety, which can be governed by similar mechanisms to depression (though not always). Though it can be influencer enough of anxiety without inherently causing it: You fundamentally think and act differently from others, and the world isn’t built to your scale.

Also, it’s practically impossible for me (and other ADHDers I know) to form habits. Even if you do something at the same time every day, if you accidentally miss a day, chances are you’ll miss the next few too. It’s a conscious effort to do things on a daily basis, especially hygiene. Shoutout to dental hygiene, I promise I really do try.

Also: ADD isn’t a real diagnosis anymore, as far as I know. It’s just considered a subtype of ADHD now, since it’s not really different except in how it looks on the outside.",1638470706,341

So, for myself. I’m either hyper fixated on something, or I have zero motivation to do something. And that fixation can be amazing for getting work done. But if someone breaks my concentration, it’s gone, and is not coming back. 

I get distracted very easy, and it’s not like “so I was walking to the store OMG A duck iTS SO CUTESE” no, we aren’t dogs. It’s like, you can’t tell a fucking story for the life of you without taking a million different paths to get there.

Why studying and flash cards didn't work.  Why I would be so interested in something and then immediately lose interest in it for months after.  Why I always had to fidget with something in the car on a trip, or bounce my leg, or just rummage through a friend's closet when we were kids because ...reasons?

Weiss_Mirror,"Self loathing, spite and all the mental illnesses that come with them.

I got diagnosed this past year after finishing my bachelors degree. While I am considered academically gifted school has always been a challenge for me. I struggled with meeting and remembering deadlines, focusing on my work, maintaining healthy sleeping habits, remembering homework etc etc. Pretty much all the classic signs of severe ADD were present in me as far back as kindergarten. Even so I went undiagnosed for years.

Instead of sitting down with me and talking to me or trying to help me with my problems, the adults in my life let me struggle. I was constantly called lazy by teachers and my parents. Doctors ignored me and told me that I didn’t need to be tested and just needed to focus on losing weight. I was given detention after detention. I failed all of my classes in middle school and several in high school. Through it all not one person thought to sit down with me and ask what was going on.

As a result of all of this shitty treatment I struggle with extreme anxiety and depression. I know now that the struggles I have had are not the result of laziness, but it is so hard to shake this perception people have been casting on you since you were a little kid. I am slowly getting better with time and therapy, but somedays the self hatred creeps back in and it hurts just as much now as it did when I was young.

My diagnosis will never make anything that happened to me in my past ok nor will it give me all the time I lost back. I have suffered a lot because of this disorder, but I am making my peace with it.

Day by day I keep getting better. I am slowly learning to accept myself and my limitations. I am letting go of all the spite I feel towards the people who shamed me instead of helping me. I still struggle, but I am kinder to myself. I keep learning how to work with my brain instead of forcing it to fit the wrong mold. Slowly I am starting to feel like a human instead of a failure.",1638469440,6

ses-qui-pedalian,"my two biggest issues are with object permanence and executive dysfunction.

the issues with object permanence relate to both people and things. i can go months without talking to people, not because i don't care about them or want to talk to them, but because they just don't cross my mind. if i'm not seeing someone or talking to someone everyday my brain just forgets they exist until i see them next or they reach out to me. it's super frustrating and so difficult to keep in contact with friends who don't live near me. i absolutely want to talk to them and maintain a relationship, but i just completely forget to do it. 

the other issues is with objects. if i buy a food item and it's behind something else in the fridge or pantry it may as well not be there at all. if i can't see it then it doesn't exist, and that thing won't be eaten. for this i've had to arrange my pantry and fridge in a way that has anything i know i won't forget about in the back and the stuff i will forget in the front. i always use spices and condiments, so i don't have to worry about forgetting those since i'll remember i have them if i want them. 

executive dysfunction is the other main issue i have. it doesn't matter how much i want to do a task, because my brain has so much trouble initiating it. it could be not doing any work until i barely have enough time to complete it, or it could be something like having to go to the bathroom. it takes so much energy to initiate a task, that sometimes i'll just be laying in bed thinking about how badly i have to go to the bathroom and just not be able to get up. it's super frustrating, because it leads to situations where i put myself under a ton of stress since i can't get things done until the last minute. it also leads to situations where i just won't have things i need like groceries because i just can't make myself go to the grocery store. it's gotten better recently since i'm back to having to leave my house to go to work and once i'm out it's much easier to do things, but during the pandemic it was such a struggle to get myself out of the house to do anything regardless of how badly i needed to do it.",1638485828,3

OverlyReductionist,"Anything to do with the so-called ""executive functions"". These functions are mostly handled by your brain's frontal lobes and are impaired in those with ADHD. ADHD is much more than an ""attention"" disorder to the extent where the name of the disorder is almost a misnomer. Personally, my most crippling problem arising from executive function deficits is a phenomenon known as 'Time blindness'.   
  
Time blindness basically means that on a subjective level I live completely in the present. All events in my brain are either happening RIGHT NOW or they are happening in some amorphous, far-off thing called the ""future"". Internally, I have no sense of the future approaching, until that future suddenly becomes the NOW.  
  
To quote Russell Barkley, ""the function of the frontal lobe is to organize your behaviour across time"".  
  
Why does this matter? Huge parts of being a functional adult have very little to do with intelligence and EVERYTHING to do with organizing behaviour across time. Life is a constant barrage of multi-step tasks that need to be juggled and completed by some point weeks or months in the future. Adults are responsible for taking all of these tasks/projects, breaking them down into chunks, scheduling time to complete them, and following through.  
  
Take something as simple as getting groceries and feeding yourself. This requires planning what you will want to eat over the next week, remembering what ingredients you already have on-hand, setting aside time to do the shopping itself, and keeping track of the stuff in your fridge that needs to be eaten/used soon or it will go bad. Along with the groceries, you probably have 4-5 other errands or tasks that need completing over the next week, and that's not even taking into account your actual career. For those with normal brains, this description sounds like I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, but that's because most people without ADHD have functional frontal lobes that can bounce around and efficiently keep on track of deadlines without being overly taxed.  
  
As someone with ADHD (poor executive function and profound time blindness), I forget what food I already have at home, forget how long those leftovers have been sitting in the fridge, and forget the leftovers even exist in the first place. Keeping on top of groceries alone is hugely taxing, let alone trying to keep on top of the rest of my life.  
  
As a side note, ADHD is frequently mischaracterized in the media. Despite the majority of the public having little to no actual scientific background on the topic, everyone feels entitled to pass judgment on the legitimacy of the disorder (or how the disorder is diagnosed). These same people would never would never go up to someone diagnosed with colon cancer and opine on whether they ""believe"" in colon cancer, but for whatever reason everyone feels qualified to pass judgment on whether kids ought to be treated with stimulant medication and/or whether parenting styles are the cause of ADHD diagnoses.",1638487519,3

I buy a bunch of my ""safe foods"" that are easy to prepare, but then my brain randomly decides to stop wanting that thing right away and they go to waste.

The overdraft fees every time my poor ass forgets about something coming out of my account and overspends.

The medications, doctors visits, therapy, etc I need just to somewhat function like a goddamn adult.

As far as applying myself, I have to work twice as hard to keep focused on something for any period of time. I spend twice as much energy doing so, and spend twice the time triple checking work to ensure it's correct.

ADHD meds are heavily regulated because non-ADHD dickbags take them when they don't need them and get addicted.

vortexnl,"I'm a bit late to the party but I'll try to chime in anyways...

For most of us, it's a constant battle of dopamine management. Since we're on a low-dopamine state by default, we tend to 'self medicate' by always finding something new and exciting to do, which means many hobbies are dropped in the process... It's extremely difficult to maintain discipline throughout one activity, because everything just becomes boring. However, we can also get hyper fixated on interesting activities, which means other (more important) activities are dropped, which can also cause personal problems... 

Due to the natural low-dopamine state, and wanting to seek new and exciting things, this makes people with ADHD more likely to develop addictions. For me this was the case as well, but now that I'm getting medication that raises dopamine levels, life has gotten way better. 

I'm still trying to finish my bachelors degree, approaching 10 years now. I have an interesting job and school is just a pain in the ass for me, and incredibly boring, but I just have to finish it for the degree. Work itself can be a pain too when I have to do boring tasks, because it feels like ANYTHING is more interesting than that task, it makes you feel like you're useless and lazy, even though it's just fighting an uphill battle with your brain.

I  think ADHD is a real curse and blessing kind of thing. I'm in my late 20's and have already had  2 burn-outs, but because of ADHD, I also have a wide range of interests and a skillset which means won't have trouble getting another job if I want to.",1638530594,2

And then, of course, the advice for ADHD is ""you need to make a schedule!"" Thanks. If I were capable of that, I wouldn't be in this boat.",1647950754,2

Nature_Ok,I'm a working adult with ADHD. Lately the thing I've become most self conscious of is my inability to pay attention during meetings. I've missed some vital information because of it. It's been made worse now that all my meeting are remote (it's easier for me to pay attention during in person meetings) which unfortunately doesn't look like it will change anytime soon.,1638466064,1
wimwood,"As a woman raised in the days of “adhd is a boy’s problem”….

*my brothers got medication. I got notes from the teachers about being a “wiggleworm” and “opinionated.”

*SPD wasn’t a thing back then either. I got my ass beat for crying about my sock seams or the waist of my jeans. My sweet 6yo got OT and lots of love and understanding.

*Being an adult woman in the professional world and not understanding how everyone else sat in the same position for the entire length of the meeting. Like. How?! I didn’t even know it was an adhd thing until I was diagnosed at like 34. I just thought I was immature and broken.

*overcompensating and being considered a “Type A” personality as a younger adult, because the only way I’d found to not lose my shit as a working mother, was to be organized to the point of lunacy. Type A is not a compliment, it’s code word for asshole. But with no help from the world I had to create extreme organization and systems for myself and god help anyone who throws off the system.

*when my adhd brothers got C/D grades, their meds were increased. I brought home a 98% on a fucking nation-wide standardized test, and was disappointed in myself for not getting 100%. Only as an adult did I look back at that round of testing and realize it meant I was testing in the top 2% of the entire nation of 10 year olds. Perfection was expected of girls. 

*Head injury at 12 combined with adhd was all written off as rebellious hormonal teen girl. I feel super sorry for my early teen self now. I needed a neuropsych eval, not prayer.

*realizing how much better my career and salary and lifestyle provided to my children could have been, if it had been recognized and diagnosed when I was even a teen. A whole lot of loss. 

*being written off as anxiety and depression for almost my entire 20s. Funny, I didn’t need treatment for anxiety or depression once I addressed the adhd with Adderall.

*taking those first meds in mid30s and having a crisis for a few months as I realized this is what it’s supposed to feel like to be a grown up. 💔",1638498427,3

They resist getting in the bath then resist getting out. A few ADHD people said they too hate that “transition”. Disclaimer - I’m not a psychologist, just noticed a pattern.",1638475158,0
